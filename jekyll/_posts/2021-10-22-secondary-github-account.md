# how to use a secondary github account from the terminal

## introduction

This has been a big headache for me for a long time. I want to use more than one github account. It is ridiculously difficult. For some reason none of of the various instructions I followed worked, until this one did. Links at bottom to various other resources on the same subject. 

This is set up per-repo. More clever automated solutions exist, see links at bottom. But they never worked for me. 

The instructions that finally cracked it for me: [Quick Tip: How to Work with GitHub and Multiple Accounts](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-work-with-github-and-multiple-accounts--net-22574)

## assumptions and variables

This is not comprehensive at explaining how to use github, `git` or the terminal from scratch. It is just to fill in existing knowledge. Also I assume you do everything the same way I do. If you don't like it feel free to return to the original tutorials. 

Do it with an empty repo and make sure everything has gone correctly because if you screw it up it's really not so easy to backtrack. 

**Note** replace the emojis

üçÖ =  your secondary username 

ü•ï = repo name

## one time set up

create a new `ssh` key for use with new account in `~/ssh/id_ed25519-üçÖ` and add it to the keychain 

- Here is the official docs on how to do that: [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

add to `~/ssh/.config`:

```sh
Host github-üçÖ
	HostName github.com
	User git
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519-üçÖ
```

## for each repo you want to use your secondary identity

Create new repo locally:

```sh
‚ùØ mkdir ü•ï
‚ùØ cd ü•ï
‚ùØ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in ü•ï/.git/
```

Make a tiny nothing commit:

```sh\
‚ùØ git commit -m "init git"
On branch main
Initial commit
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

Login to github and create ü•ï repo there

- Be sure to create the  `README.md`

Sync local and remote:


```sh
‚ùØ git remote add origin git@github-üçÖ:üçÖ/ü•ï
‚ùØ git pull origin main
From github-üçÖ:üçÖ/ü•ï
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
‚ùØ ls
README.md
```

open the `README.md`¬†make some tiny change and save it.

```sh
‚ùØ nano README.md
```

edit your local  `ü•ï/git/config`¬†to add (use your correct commit email)

```sh
[user]
	name = üçÖ
	email = 000000+üçÖ@users.noreply.github.com 
[pull]
	rebase = false
[branch "main"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/main
```

send local files to remote

```sh
‚ùØ git add README.md
‚ùØ git commit -m "change readme local"

‚ùØ git push origin main

## troubleshooting

### primary account should stay authenticated via `ssh`

if you check your ID via `ssh`, it will still say your main account:

```sh
‚ùØ ssh -T git@github.com
Hi CouldBeThis! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

even if you are in a repo set up with secondary account, the primary one will appear. 

It has happened to me once or twice somehow that the secondary account became what showed up here, but I do not know how or why. 

When that happened I re added the key associated with this account to `ssh agent`¬†(Mac): 

```sh
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519-CouldBeThis
```

Which solved it. 

### who am I?

If you are having problems, here is how to determine which `git config` is being applied in case somehow there has been an error in that.  

```sh
‚ùØ git config --show-origin user.name
‚ùØ git config --show-origin user.email
```
